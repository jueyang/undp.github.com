The 2011 Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration is the mechanism through which key stakeholders will determine whether these targets have been met. Its results will form a key input to the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (Korea, November 2011).\r\nBuilding on their successful partnership to date and significant track record in supporting partner country leadership and participation in the survey process, the OECD and United Nations Development Programme will, in collaboration with interested donors and regional stakeholders, deliver a package of support focused around five regional workshops to ensure the successful roll-out of the 2011 PD Survey. Linkages with other monitoring activities  including the 2011 Fragile States Principles Survey  will be made, ensuring useful synergies and cost-effectiveness.\r\nThese workshops will ensure that key partner country stakeholders involved in the management of the Surveys are briefed on the process and technical aspects of the 2011 Surveys, and will offer an opportunity for partner country practitioners to exchange experiences and best practice around the Paris monitoring processes, further strengthening ownership and participation in preparation for the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. It will provide a timely opportunity to share progress on the preparations for HLF4 and seek partner country perspectives on what HLF4 should seek to achieve.\r\nThis proposal forms part of UNDP's Global Project on Capacity Development for Aid Effectiveness 2009-2011.","output_id":"00076174","output_title":"PD Survey Regional Workshops"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00050716","project_title":"Capacity Development for Aid Effectiveness","region_id":"global","start":"2009-06-15","subnational":[{"awardID":"00050716","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"","lon":"","name":"Global","outputID":"00062772","output_locID":"00062772-1","precision":"","type":""},{"awardID":"00050716","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"","lon":"","name":"Global","outputID":"00076472","output_locID":"00076472-1","precision":"","type":""}]}
