The results will provide the basis for priority mitigation actions like community based and managed early warning systems and integrated contingency planning and mobilization. \n\nThe project will also conduct massive information, education and communications campaign to raise the awareness of the general public on climate change and its impacts, as well as, enhance the competencies of the concerned local government units on mainstreaming climate/disaster risk management into local land use and development planning and regulatory processes. To increase the resilience of vulnerable communities, the Project will support the development of climate resilient livelihoods and risk sharing/transfer models. The Project will also help cull and organize knowledge on climate/disaster risk management for vulnerable communities.","output_id":"00081792","output_title":"Enabling Regs X & XI to Cope"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00065172","project_title":"Enabling Regions X and XI to Cope with Climate Change","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2012-03-15","subnational":[{"awardID":"00065172","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"8.48222","lon":"124.64722","name":"Cagayan de Oro City","outputID":"00081792","output_locID":"00081792-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00065172","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"8.25","lon":"124.4","name":"Iligan City","outputID":"00081792","output_locID":"00081792-2","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00065172","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"7.60755","lon":"125.9586","name":"Compostela Valley","outputID":"00081792","output_locID":"00081792-3","precision":"4","type":"RES"},{"awardID":"00065172","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"6.95508","lon":"126.21655","name":"Davao Oriental","outputID":"00081792","output_locID":"00081792-4","precision":"4","type":"PPLA2"}]}
