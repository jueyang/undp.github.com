This will be done through preparation of a comprehensive Disaster and Risk Assessment, creation of a web-based software application and disaster risk maps. In parallel, actions will be taken at the local level to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen capacities to manage disaster and climate risks at local levels.  Local level risk management will be mainstreamed into and delivered through development of disaster and climate risk management plans in selected high risk municipalities that will, among the other,  include: priorities, concrete activities and actions, resources (financial and human), as well as through implementation of small scale demonstration and/or pilot measures identified in the these plans. In addition, targeted capacity building and public awareness/advocacy/education activities will be carried out countrywide.","output_id":"00078215","output_title":"Disaster & Climate Risks"},{"award_id":"00049400","budget":[35495.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":[""],"donor_name":["GOVERNMENT OF MACEDONIA, THE FORMER YUGO"],"donor_short":[],"expenditure":[35474.0],"fiscal_year":["2011"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"None","gender_id":"0","output_descr":"The implementation of the Law on Crisis Management supported and strengthened through providing technical assistance to strengthen both institutional and operational capacities and mechanisms of the Crisis Management Centre, in order to enable the Centre to play better coordination and service provider roles in crisis management, while promoting the human development approach to crisis management among its partners.","output_id":"00060186","output_title":"Disaster Risk Reduction"}],"project_descr":"Strengthening disaster risk reduction capacities of the national institutions through providing technical assistance to the National Crisis Management System.","project_id":"00049400","project_title":"National Disaster Risk Reduction","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2008-02-13","subnational":[{"awardID":"00049400","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"41.83333","lon":"22","name":"Macedonia","outputID":"00078215","output_locID":"00078215-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
