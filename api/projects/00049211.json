The program has been developed as a follow-up to the \"Strengthening Capacities to Combat Corruption in Tanzania\" that supported the first phase of NACSAP, 2001-2005. Conceived through an extensive consultative process, the program represents the desire of all actors, including Tanzania's development partners to sustain the anticorruption momentum generated by the exposure of alleged grand corruption and the Government's positive responses. Inspired by the Government's commitment, the SACST seeks, through financial and technical support, to secure and expand the anticorruption effort by strengthening the capacity of national integrity institutions, including PCCB, GGCU and DPP and to support the expansion of NACSAP to include Civil Society, the Private Sector, Local Government Authorities and the core national reform processes.","output_id":"00059842","output_title":"Strengthening Anti Corruption"}],"project_descr":"STRENGTHENING ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGIES IN TANZANIA\"\r\nA Programme of Support for NACSAP II","project_id":"00049211","project_title":"Strengthening Anti Corruption Strategies in Tanzania","region_id":"RBA","start":"2008-01-01","subnational":[]}
