The main expected outcomes are: (i) Governance framework for PA expansion created: will result in: (a) Coastal Forest patches gazetted and managed with cost-effective and sustainable approaches as Protected Areas; (b) Appropriate policy, regulatory, financial and institutional governance frameworks will be in place, covering the PAs and peripheral \"buffer\" resources, and providing for PA functions such as enforcement, planning and site monitoring; (c) Coordination and collaboration among district and central government protected area level institutions for protected area planning and management, lead to improved conservation; and (d) financial sustainability plans developed and implemented within all areas in the network-capitalising on existing/potential tourism and energy scenarios; (ii) Institutional Capacity within PA authorities in Zanzibar and the mainland is strengthened, to deliver mandated conservation functions and ensure that conservation efforts are better integrated with development programs; and (iii) New protected area management options and partnerships trialed at three highest priority landscapes in Zanzibar (57,000ha); the KichiMatumbi Hills (26,000 ha) and greater Rondo system on the Tanzanian mainland (15,000ha).
