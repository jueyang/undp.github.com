While some progress has been made, the effective and accountable delivery of quality public services at the local level still faces considerable challenges in terms of limited capacity to design and implement integrated local development strategies, insufficient organizational development and financial management in line with the principles of good local governance and  lack of understanding of benefits of inter-municipal cooperation. \nThe project will address these challenges through following components:  1: Developing  prioritized and mature project pipeline that is aligned with strategic priorities at national and local level in pilot municipalities; 2: Improving transparency and accountability of municipal financial management, 3: Enhancing local service delivery through inter-municipal cooperation  4:  Improving municipal and ministries' management practices in order to deliver better quality of services to the citizens in a transparent, accountable and cost-effective manner.","output_id":"00088051","output_title":"Integrated Local Development"}],"project_descr":"Project will address following:Developing project pipeline in pilot municipalities;Improving transparency/accountability of municipal financial management,Enhancing local service delivery,Improving municipal and ministries' management practices.","project_id":"00076967","project_title":"Integrated Local Development","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2013-11-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00076967","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"42.5","lon":"19.3","name":"Montenegro","outputID":"00088051","output_locID":"00088051-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
