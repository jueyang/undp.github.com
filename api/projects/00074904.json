The list of required items has been prepared and vetted by Ministry of Health in Gaza, reviewed by UNDP/PAPP, and contributes to much-needed medical supplies for hospitals in Gaza, with a particular emphasis on drugs pertaining to oncology (cancer), one of the most widespread non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Palestine. The initiative, thus, aims to support efforts to ensure that MoH in Gaza has access to the appropriate medical supplies required to support cancer patients.\r\nThe management and implementation of the programme will be supported by a Programme Management Unit (PMU) in UNDP/PAPP, including a Programme Manager, Procurement Officer and Finance Officer.
