In addition, technical support will be continued to ongoing DRR programmes at the country level. A major thrust of DRT's work plan s to orient all its thematic areas to meet the specific demands emanating from the country offices either through direct support or through partnerships. In partnership with BDP/CDG, DRT will provide support to three COs for DRR capacity assessments and designing capacity development strategies. DRT will also support assessment of recovery capacities in five countries that will form a basis for capacity development in this area.  Technical support will be provided in the area of risk identification to country programmes that include this area of work. The main focus of DRT's mainstreaming work  is to support the application of tools and methodologies developed in previous years to specific country contexts. One major area of support to country programmes will be in the area of climate risk management \r\nTechnical advice will be provided to selected countries on integrating DRR into the CCA/UNDAF.  Further support will be provided to the CCA/UNDAF process through expert roster, capacity development of UNSSC facilitators, UNRC coordination officers and DRR practitioners.","output_id":"00059431","output_title":"Basic DRR Country Programme"},{"award_id":"00048976","budget":[277505.0],"crs":"15210","crs_descr":"Security system management and reform","donor_id":[""],"donor_name":["DEPARTMENT FOR INT'L DEVELOPMENT (DFID)"],"donor_short":[],"expenditure":[374362.0],"fiscal_year":["2011"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"None","gender_id":"0","output_descr":"National Cap.
