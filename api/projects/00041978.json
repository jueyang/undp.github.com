It proposes a range of capacity development interventions, aimed at improving the NHRC's performance over the medium to long term in relation to investigations, monitoring, complaints, research, public education and advocacy of human rights. These include: the provision of experienced NHRI practitioners from the region as well as local human rights expertise to provide advice to Commissioners and staff to set up appropriate and effective institutional frameworks and to undertake in-country training; fellowships; peer exchanges with, and work placements, in NHRIs in the region and human rights organisations nationally. It also includes development of the Commission's organisational structure, human resource strategy, preparation of complaints procedures and case management system.

There is increasing demand for improvements in the administration of timely affordable, timely and equitable justice. One of the key constraints facing the judiciary is the large case backlog of around 1.8 million cases. The backlog is placing considerable pressure on the court system and is hampering access to justice. It is also symptomatic of a number of other issues, including complex procedures and a lack of effective case management. The Supreme Court has requested UNDP to support the Judiciary to strengthen its capacity to administer the court system and reduce the case backlogs. A reduction would provide a sustainable foundation to improve access to justice to the public, especially, vulnerable groups such as the poor, women and children.  \r\nThe project, known as JUST (Judicial Strengthening), will focus on four outputs:\r\n1.\tImproved case management in the Supreme Court;\r\n2.\tImproved strategic planning and administrative capacity of the Supreme Court; \r\n3.\t3 district courts deliver improved services for court users; and\r\n4.\tStrengthened training capacity on case-management.","output_id":"00081908","output_title":"Judicial Strengthening"},{"award_id":"00041978","budget":[1144729.0,313750.0],"crs":"15130","crs_descr":"Legal and judicial development","donor_id":["00012","00551"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions","DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT"],"donor_short":["UNDP","DFID"],"expenditure":[898474.0,50282.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012"],"focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Strengthening the formal justice system and the rule of law is a priority for the Government of Bangladesh.

The backlog is placing considerable pressure on the sector and is hampering access to justice. It is also symptomatic of a number of other issues, including complex procedures and a lack of effective case management between agencies. UNDP, through the experience generated from the Justice Sector Strategic Development project, has facilitated a process that has shown appreciation of the benefits of moving towards a more coordinated approach between justice sector institutions. Building on these positive results a new project establishing a Justice Sector Facility will work across the sector to strengthen institutional planning capacities across the sector as well as support two district pilots to improve the administration of criminal justice between agencies. The project will focus on three outputs:\r\n1.\tCommunication, coordination and co-operation between justice agencies enhanced in two district pilots through establishment of solutions for inter-agency case management; \r\n2.\tSelected agencies have improved strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, delivery of government legal aid, and prosecution of cases; and\r\n3.\tStrengthened cross sectoral dialogue and sector wide coordination mechanism established.","output_id":"00083546","output_title":"Justice Sector Facility"},{"award_id":"00041978","budget":[519079.0],"crs":"15130","crs_descr":"Legal and judicial development","donor_id":[""],"donor_name":["UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME"],"donor_short":[],"expenditure":[511029.0],"fiscal_year":["2011"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"None","gender_id":"0","output_descr":"This Preparatory Assistance Programme has been developed in order to support the Supreme Court's newly established Special Committee.
