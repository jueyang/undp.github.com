It is comprised of six stand-alone, interrelated \"Blue Prints\" aiming for the following objectives: \r\n\r\n(1) Setting up of a permanent Strategic Planning capability;\r\n\r\n(2) Enhancement of the Mauritius Police reactive capability;\r\n\r\n(3) Intelligence-Led Policing / Development of pro-active responses;\r\n\r\n(4) Community Policing / Increased accountability to the public;\r\n\r\n(5) Establishment of a Human Resource Management system;\r\n\r\n(6) Achieving a Human Rights-compliant organization / Commitment to professional standards. \r\n\r\nThe 2010 phase of this project will focus on strengthening the Strategic Planning structures and competences of the Mauritius Police and guiding the roll-out of certain Blue Prints (starting with the \"Community Policing\" and \"Intelligence-Led Policing\" ones, regarded as catalytic for the successful operationalization of other Blue Prints).","output_id":"00070528","output_title":"Police Force to Police Service"}],"project_descr":"From Police Force to Police Service: Supporting the Transition through Strategic Planning and Organizational Change Management","project_id":"00057165","project_title":"National Policing Strategic Framework","region_id":"RBA","start":"2009-04-30","subnational":[]}
