The UNDP response to the challenges of regional cooperation in Central Asia is to look at cooperation not as end in itself but purely as a contribution to human development and greater equity in income distribution as well as security in the region. With the Central Asia Human Development Report, UNDP has defined the issues and identified the avenues for regional cooperation.  In the next few years, the challenge will be to keep the issues of regional cooperation \"alive\".  This will be done through periodic outreach and advocacy activities (conferences, focus group discussions, workshops and publications) both at the sub-regional and national level. Special attention is paid to regional risks - to monitor them, a study will be produced and widely discussed with various stakeholders","output_id":"00056231","output_title":"Advocacy and Outreach in CA"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00047000","project_title":"Central Asia Sub-Regional Project","region_id":"global","start":"2007-04-11","subnational":[]}
