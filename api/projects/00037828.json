The proposed project will address the policy, institutional, financial, information and technological barriers to provide an effective, sustainable and environment-friendly urban public transport system, planned and regulated at local levels of government. Thus, the practical demonstration of urban transport improvement measures will be linked to substantial changes in the design of stadia in the selected venue cities of the World Cup and in the transport services that provide access to these venues. The DoT proposes the use of GEF PDF funds to support both the re-design of spectator access to stadia (eliminate mass private vehicle parking) and the provision of public transport services and non-motorised transport infrastructure to the stadia in two selected 2010 host cities. Furthermore, the project will work with other 2010 host cities and selected municipalities across the country to influence transportation policies, build institutional and individual capacities and raise awareness.","output_id":"00041451","output_title":"Transport 2010"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00037828","project_title":"PIMS 3276 CC PDF B Sustainable Public Transport 2010","region_id":"RBA","start":"2005-02-01","subnational":[]}
