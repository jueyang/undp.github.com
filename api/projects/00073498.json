The destruction or drainage of peatlands does not only release GHGs, but also destroys important ecosystems that are essential for biodiversity. Therefore the objective of the pilot project in Ukraine is to demonstrate how within one landscape certain areas of abandoned degraded agricultural peatlands that emit carbon can be restored, while adjacent areas can be protected at the same time to increase carbon sequestration.","output_id":"00086272","output_title":"Peatland restoration"}],"project_descr":"The project will demonstrate how within one landscape certain areas of abandoned degraded agricultural peatlands that emit carbon can be restored, while adjacent areas can be protected at the same time to increase carbon sequestration.","project_id":"00073498","project_title":"Conservation and Sustainable Use of Peatlands","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2013-03-15","subnational":[{"awardID":"00073498","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"49","lon":"32","name":"Ukraine","outputID":"00086272","output_locID":"00086272-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
