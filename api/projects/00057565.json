In the short term, an important objective will be to provide information on climate risks and poverty in Aceh's villages, as well as gather information on the efforts of local populations to tackle these problems. Such information is crucial in order to strengthen the local government's capacity to implement the Aceh Green-plan and to develop environmentally sound and sustainable policies. \r\nThe project will train local young researchers in Aceh with the aim of them becoming experts on climate risk management and poverty. These scholars will in the future be in a position to provide policy advice on climate change and poverty issues to the local government of Aceh.","output_id":"00071187","output_title":"Training on Climate Change"}],"project_descr":"This project aims to train local junior researchers in the Indonesian province of Aceh to do research and provide policy advice on issues related to climate change and poverty.","project_id":"00057565","project_title":"Training Future Experts on CC & Poverty in Aceh","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2009-07-01","subnational":[]}
