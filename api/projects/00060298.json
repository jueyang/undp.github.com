This will be accomplished through the introduction of a new performance-based energy efficiency building code, including minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) and energy-labeling of new buildings, standards for EE materials, capacity building of principal stakeholders and an appropriate compliance regime to ensure that these new requirements will be effectively implemented. The building code will also take into account geographical climatic variability within the country and will anticipate changes due to global warming, thereby adapting the construction of new buildings to reflect both the present and the expected future climate conditions","output_id":"00075861","output_title":"EnergyEffeciency Buildingcode"}],"project_descr":"Preparation of  full Energy Efficiency Building Code in the Syrian Arab Republic","project_id":"00060298","project_title":"Full EE Building Code in Syria","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2010-08-01","subnational":[]}
