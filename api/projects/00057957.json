Populations of many globally threatened species are still found here, from snow leopard and lynx to the highly endangered Woolly Flying Squirrel. Although protected areas now cover some 11% of the mountains, and community co-managed conservancies a further 12%, threats remain to the region's unique biodiversity, due to poverty and limited options for sustainable sources of livelihood. The project will use voluntary certification of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP) as a tool to promote biodiversity conservation and strengthen existing conservation efforts with innovative market-based mechanisms. The project will develop community and institutional capacity for certified production of 'biodiversity-friendly' NTFPs in northern Pakistan and stimulate market demand for biodiversity friendly NTFP thereby creating new economic incentives for conservation.","output_id":"00071784","output_title":"Mountain & Markets Project"}],"project_descr":"Stimulate market demand for biodiversity friendly Non-Timber Forest Products","project_id":"00057957","project_title":"Mountain & Markets Project","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2009-08-01","subnational":[]}
