It will look into geography and how it may help explain both sub-national and community-based living conditions and trends and the spatial impact of specific public policies and programs thus far. It also seeks to generate concrete findings and a greater understanding of how human development outcomes in the Philippines across time and space have been directly or indirectly influenced by physical and environmental processes, features and phenomena, and vice versa.
