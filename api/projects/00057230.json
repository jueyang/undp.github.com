By using this management tool (GIS), GMMRWUA will be able to reorganize all water resources data in a geographically referenced computerized data base and improve information access for enhanced water resources monitoring and agricultural land use planning. This project is thus meant to be an instrument to provide adequate knowledge and technology to GMMRWUA, that it requires for the planning, design and implementation of an Enterprise Geographic Information System (GIS). Furthermore, this project is designed to support GMMRWUA through the development of a consultative process that includes training activities and provision of the authority's departments with technical support.
