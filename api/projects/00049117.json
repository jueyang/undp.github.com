This will be achieved by the construction of stone walls, check dams and water collection reservoirs to prevent runoff water from reaching villages and farms along the Assi river and through the restoration of land cover to reduce soil erosion. The project will also work on land cover improvement to reduce soil erosion through reforestation and pasture rehabilitation in the target area. The project is financed by the Government of Spain through the Lebanon Recovery Fund, and is in line with the UNDP's development goal of alleviating poverty in rural drylands of the conflict-affected Baalback Hermel area.","output_id":"00069789","output_title":"Flood II"},{"award_id":"00049117","budget":[763899.0],"crs":"41010","crs_descr":"Environmental policy and administrative management","donor_id":[""],"donor_name":["LEBANON RECOVERY FUND"],"donor_short":[],"expenditure":[680911.0],"fiscal_year":["2011"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"None","gender_id":"0","output_descr":"The project aims at assisting the Government of Lebanon in its recovery efforts in the conflict-affected and high-poverty region of Baalbeck-Hermel through land management practices, namely flood risk reduction and improved access to irrigation water and networks to achieve crop diversification and improve productivity.
