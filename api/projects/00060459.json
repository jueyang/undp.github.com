The project proposal developed with this support proposed to target 10,000 Level 3 officers during a 12-month pilot exercise, and proposed to use a training programme combining classroom and distance learning methods. In subsequent discussions between the Ministry of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration, the Official Languages Department and UNDP, it was agreed, that while the proposal provided some useful entry-points and innovative activities, there was still a need to be far more strategic, with respect to its proposed targeting and proposed scope of training activities, also taking into consideration resource availability. It was also agreed that it would be useful to target a particular professional sector and category within the public service within a select geographic foci, in order to test the effectiveness and demonstrate the results of such a targeted approach, as a model for bilingual competency development of the public sector in the future.
