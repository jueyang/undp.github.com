Despite several factors that impede agricultural development, such as lack of extension services, difficulty to access credits, and high costs of production, there are few niches of production with high potential. By strengthening the integrated channel (breeding/dairy products), including downstream and upstream activities, as well as targeting breeders and small-scale industrialists involved in the processing phase, the project will improve competitiveness and quality of local productions.","output_id":"00059954","output_title":"Strengthening Dairy Production"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00049267","project_title":"Strengthening the dairy production channel in the North","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2008-01-30","subnational":[]}
