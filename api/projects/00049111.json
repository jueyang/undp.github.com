The Project will be working to overcome identified barriers for safe and sustainable management of PCBs at all stages of their life cycle. It will consist of 3 Outcomes:\r\n1) Strengthened legal, policy and administrative framework for PCB management and disposal;\r\n2) Safe PCB management at PCB holder level introduced and further PCB sources identified;\r\n3) Pure PCB containing equipment in participating industries disposed of. The Project will emphasize on capacity building to develop the legal and administrative systems as well as managing and disposing of industrial-sized equipment with pure , or high concentrations of PCBs. In addition, safe management of all PCB contaminated material at holder and handler level will be increased. The approach of targeting pure PCB sources initially is in-line with priorities of Part II of Annex A of the Stockholm Convention. The overall tonnage of pure PCB to be destroyed within the framework of the project is 150 tons plus an additional estimated 55 tons. This will, with equipment casings, total a disposal of 685 tons of PCB waste.","output_id":"00059653","output_title":"Gestion PCBs -Pilier I"}],"project_descr":"PIMS 3714: Safe PCB Management and Disposal in Morocco_Pillar I","project_id":"00049111","project_title":"Programme de Gestion Rationnelle et Elimination des PCB","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2009-02-12","subnational":[{"awardID":"00049111","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"32","lon":"-6","name":"Morocco","outputID":"00059653","output_locID":"00059653-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
