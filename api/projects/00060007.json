The project has four indicators and targets that measure adaptive capacity, in line with the GEF V Results Framework. The project will support the development of human, social, natural, physical and financial capitals to enable communities and government to continue the results delivered with this project grant.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to develop the capacity of communities living in the coastal zones of Mozambique to manage climate change by: i) developing the capacity for climate risk analysis, generating climate change risk analysis and mainstreaming it into policies, investment plans, sector budgets and livelihood strategies at the national and sub-national level ii) piloting measures to improve livelihood resilience to climate change.\r\n\r\nThe Project is distinctly action-oriented and country-driven from the very first days of the PPG process.

Therefore, the LDCF project will seek to generate policy-relevant information to help mainstream climate change adaptation into the national planning processes. One of the Government plans relevant to the proposed LDCF project is the National Action Plan on Erosion. This nationwide action plan covers all forms of erosion, and acts as an important baseline but does not have a particular focus on climate change-induced erosion and the impacts of climate change on the coastline. Additionally, the government (led by MICOA) is about to engage in the development of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) which will focus on the entire coastline of Mozambique. This will be undertaken over the next three years, will involve extensive data collection and stakeholder involvement from all sectors and will, once completed, inform land-use decision-making and territorial planning at all levels (local, sub-national and national) in coastal zones. The proposed LDCF project's focus on coastal zones and climate change-induced erosion is consistent with these plans and processes and will contribute knowledge to them. \r\n\r\nThis project will address urgent and immediate climate change adaptation needs and leverage co-financing resources from bilateral and other multilateral sources. The project is country-driven, cost-effective, and will integrate climate change risk considerations into land-use planning, coastal management and disaster risk reduction initiatives, which are priority interventions eligible under the LDCF guidelines. The project focus of safeguarding Mozambique's coastal communities and ecosystems against future climate risk by pursuing a range of coastal adaptive practices is aligned with the scope of expected interventions supported by the LDCF.","output_id":"00075315","output_title":"Adaptation in the coastal zone"},{"award_id":"00060007","budget":[91001.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["10003"],"donor_name":["Global Environment Fund Truste"],"donor_short":["GEFTrustee"],"expenditure":[0.0],"fiscal_year":["2012"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"The project has two Outcomes relating to the development of adaptive capacity to manage the effects of climate change on coastal resources.
