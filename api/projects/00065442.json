Unplanned urbanization, environmental degradation, population growth and poverty are some of the inter-linked factors that increase the vulnerability of a large number of communities in Cape Verde.  Small islands economy, infrastructure, and human costs are hugely impacted by disasters which hinders the prospect of the sustainable development.
