In particular, the following will be addressed: 1) drainage of fens, 2) lack of appropriate management of protected fen areas, 3) lack of public awareness and appreciation of peatland biodiversity, 4) low institutional capacity to address threats to fen biodiversity, 5) weak policy environment to ensure adequate protection of fen biodiversity. Activities realized in three pilot areas will serve to demonstrate best practices in restoring and managing these valuable habitats, and lessons learned will be applied to the development and maintenance of the Natura 2000 network in Slovakia, with a special emphasis on conservation of fen and peatland biodiversity.","output_id":"00043875","output_title":"PIMS1998 BD: MSP Rich Fens SK"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00039192","project_title":"PIMS 1998 BD: MSP Rich Fens Slovakia","region_id":"global","start":"2005-01-01","subnational":[]}
