The project will revise the legal, regulatory and policy framework to better support the adoption of renewable energy technologies, and grid-connected PV systems in particular; design and implement financial mechanisms that will make the purchase and installation of solar PV systems more attractive to the private sector; establish the first market supply chain for solar PV systems in the country; provide training to establish local capacity for the installation and maintenance of PV systems; and demonstrate for the first time in the Seychelles the viability and practicality of grid-connected PV systems through demonstration PV systems.  Together, these actions are designed to play a critical role in \"jump-starting\" the adoption of solar PV technology in the Seychelles, and in setting the stage for broad-scale replication by reducing the costs of PV technology through a market-based approach that will establish financial incentive mechanisms for PV systems and reduce transaction costs.
