Using local civil society partners, strengthen the skill base of a variety of actors  such as key central government officials, parliamentarians, representatives from oblast and local authority, and other civic leaders on conflict prevention, conflict sensitive development, and collaborative decision-making, through a targeted package of experiential training, and mentoring. Particular attention will be paid to ensure the participation of women leaders in this capacity development effort at both the national and local levels.
