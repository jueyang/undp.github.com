The project aims to offer political support, financial incentives and technical assistance for the development of a National Training Programme for local elected representatives and establish appropriate institutional arrangements for delivering the programme. The project offers a comprehensive package for capacity building through supply-driven induction training for newly elected hural members, complemented by innovative training methodologies such as identification and dissemination of best practices on citizen participation, and the development of tools to support hurals in their oversight functions. Regular monitoring, including institutional and context analysis of power structures at local level, and lessons learned from the project will result in an improved legal framework for local self-governance.","output_id":"00085982","output_title":"Capacity Strengthening of Loca"}],"project_descr":"Local Self-Governing Bodies","project_id":"00073029","project_title":"Capacity Strengthening of Local Self-Governing Bodies","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2013-03-15","subnational":[{"awardID":"00073029","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"46","lon":"105","name":"Mongolia","outputID":"00085982","output_locID":"00085982-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
