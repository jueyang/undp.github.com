Continued post-conflict peace and security, political stability and macro-economic management that have been conducive to growth and development have highlighted this. Political and economic reforms in the country are allowing for an ever-increasing role for the sub-national levels in policy development and implementation.

The PARPA II has an action plan and monitoring system, which is currently used by donors to determine the levels of funding, committed to government programmes and to the General Budget Support (which currently represents about 30% of donor aid).
