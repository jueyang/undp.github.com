After the local elections in 2008, the number of elected women decreased, and the lack of representation in elected bodies for the Roma communities has not improved much. The strategy of the project \"Enhancing good governance in Romania\": Improving the Capacity of Elected Women and Minorities to Represent Citizens in Romania is therefore to support the newly elected Roma and women representatives in carrying out their mandate in a successful manner, thus maximizing their chances of being re-elected, offering examples of good practice and encouraging other Roma and women to follow their example.","output_id":"00064117","output_title":"Enhancing Good Governance in R"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00051473","project_title":"Enhancing Good Governance in Romania UDF-ROM-07-193","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2009-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00051473","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"46","lon":"25","name":"Romania","outputID":"00064117","output_locID":"00064117-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
