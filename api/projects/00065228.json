Each AT-mine is guarded by 3 APs. In addition, reinforcement minefields, also with bounding fragmentation mines, have been laid randomly and scattered along the whole NBP without proper recording, complicating the clearance/verification implementation significantly.\n\nThe National Committee for Demining and Rehabilitation (NCDR) tasked Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) to undertake the project after they successfully completed the Southern Border/Wadi Araba project.  NCDR is responsible to provide independent quality management and continuously conduct QA/QC of all NPA operations.","output_id":"00081825","output_title":"Northern Border Mine Clearance"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00065228","project_title":"Northern Border Mine Clearance - Canada","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2012-04-01","subnational":[]}
