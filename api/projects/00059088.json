This, in turn, is expected to generate global benefits of almost 250,000 tons of CO2 over the same period and almost 113,000 tons CO2/yr thereafter in avoided greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The project will do this by introducing a competitive private power framework to supply the grid with SHP-generated electricity at market-determined prices, assist the Government in closing private sector funded SHP investments. It is envisaged that this project will permit Kyrgyzstan to exploit a substantial portion of the 570-900 MW of its potential SHP capacity.","output_id":"00073756","output_title":"SMALL HYDRO POWER DEVELOPMENT"}],"project_descr":"Small Hydro Power Development","project_id":"00059088","project_title":"SMALL HYDRO POWER DEVELOPMENT","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2010-01-25","subnational":[{"awardID":"00059088","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"41.4446","lon":"74.43223","name":"Naryn","outputID":"00073756","output_locID":"00073756-1","precision":"1","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00059088","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"42.87955","lon":"76.13326","name":"Ak Tyuz","outputID":"00073756","output_locID":"00073756-2","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00059088","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"42.20388","lon":"75.9214","name":"Karakungey","outputID":"00073756","output_locID":"00073756-3","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00059088","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"42.45652","lon":"76.04791","name":"Kok Maynak","outputID":"00073756","output_locID":"00073756-4","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00059088","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"42.506","lon":"71.11886","name":"Kok say","outputID":"00073756","output_locID":"00073756-5","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00059088","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"40.06259","lon":"70.81939","name":"Batken","outputID":"00073756","output_locID":"00073756-6","precision":"4","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00059088","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"41.42866","lon":"75.99111","name":"Naryn","outputID":"00073756","output_locID":"00073756-7","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00059088","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"41","lon":"75","name":"Kyrgyzstan","outputID":"00073756","output_locID":"00073756-8","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
