Through IMC arrangements, small municipalities will be able to create economies of scale to better plan for, invest in and deliver services equitably, as well as promote green economic development. IMC can help them rationalize use of human resources, introduce specialized staff, use new technology and perform new functions such as municipal energy management.  Local governments can create single purpose associations to address one particular issue (eg. solid waste collection) or multi-purpose associations by which they jointly work on several issues (eg. economic development planning, environmental planning, and emergency management).  It is possible to have contractual agreements by which one local government provides services for another or to create joint administrative bodies, jointly founded commercial companies, or jointly funded positions.","output_id":"00078543","output_title":"Intermunicipal Cooperation"}],"project_descr":"With its implementing partner, the Network of Associations of Local Authorities of Southeast Europe (NALAS), this regional program involves local governments and local communities in addressing climate change challenges.","project_id":"00061783","project_title":"Think Globally, Develop Locally","region_id":"global","start":"2011-05-02","subnational":[{"awardID":"00061783","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","outputID":"00078544","output_locID":"00078544-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
