To achieve this target as per the agreement between the Ministry of Environment and the Executive Committee of Montreal Protocol, a combination of investment, training, technical support and institutional support activities had been developed. The National Phase-out Management Plan for CFCs enabled Lebanon to comply with the Montreal Protocol control schedule milestones of achieving 50% of the baseline consumption by 2005 and 15% of the baseline consumption by 2007. Complete phase-out is proposed to be achieved by end of 2009. The project had been implemented through five annual implementation programs with annual targets for CFC consumption and phase-out.\nNPMP will cover the technology conversions in the Aerosols, Foams and Refrigeration Sectors and also ensure timely, sustainable and cost-effective phase-out through a combination of investment, technical support, training and institutional support component.","output_id":"00043946","output_title":"National plan to phase out CFC"}],"project_descr":"National Phase Out Plan for Annexes- A Group-1 Substances (CFCs)","project_id":"00039237","project_title":"Phasing out CFCs","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2005-04-01","subnational":[]}
